# Security Implementation - Quick Start

## What Was Added

✅ **Security Headers** - Protects against common web attacks  
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks  
✅ **CSRF Protection** - Stops cross-site request forgery  
✅ **Input Sanitization** - Cleans user input to prevent XSS  
✅ **Performance Monitoring** - Tracks app performance

## Files Modified

- `next.config.js` - Added security headers
- `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` - Added rate limiting
- `src/app/episodes/page.tsx` - Added input sanitization

## Why These Are Necessary

### 1. Security Headers

**Problem:** Websites are vulnerable to click-jacking, XSS, and data theft  
**Solution:** Browser security headers that block malicious behavior  
**Benefit:** Protects users even if code has vulnerabilities

### 2. Rate Limiting

**Problem:** Attackers can overwhelm servers with requests  
**Solution:** Limit requests per IP address per time window  
**Benefit:** Keeps app responsive for legitimate users

### 3. CSRF Protection

**Problem:** Malicious sites can make requests on behalf of users  
**Solution:** Require special tokens for state-changing requests  
**Benefit:** Prevents unauthorized actions

### 4. Input Sanitization

**Problem:** User input can contain malicious scripts  
**Solution:** Clean input before processing or display  
**Benefit:** Prevents XSS attacks

## How to Test

### Test Security Headers

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Look for X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
```

### Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Make many requests quickly
for i in {1..101}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/trpc; done
# Should get 429 error after limit
```

### Test Input Sanitization

1. Go to episodes page
2. Enter `<script>alert('test')</script>` in search
3. Should see cleaned text, not popup

## Configuration

Edit `src/lib/config/security.ts` to adjust:

- Rate limit thresholds
- CSP policies
- Input sanitization rules
- CSRF settings

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis
- [ ] Add authentication integration
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test all security measures

## Getting Help

- Read `SECURITY.md` for detailed explanations
- Check `SECURITY_EXAMPLES.md` for attack scenarios
- Review code comments for implementation details

## Quick Disable (if needed)

If security measures cause issues during development:

1. **Rate limiting:** Set very high limits in `security.ts`
2. **CSP:** Use development CSP (more permissive)
3. **Input sanitization:** Comment out in form handlers

**⚠️ Never disable in production!**
