## 🆕 Next Steps: Changeset Version Management Implementation

**Priority**: Ready to implement when needed  
**Documentation**: See `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` for complete implementation guide

### Immediate User Actions (Manual)

1. **Create First Changeset**: `bun changeset`

   - Run when ready to track your first version change
   - Describe the changes and specify semver bump (patch/minor/major)
   - Commits changeset file to track planned version increment

2. **Set Up PostHog Feature Flags for Canary Rollouts**

   - Log into PostHog dashboard
   - Create feature flags for new features (e.g., `new-episode-player`)
   - Configure percentage-based rollouts (10% → 50% → 100%)
   - Set up user targeting for synthetic/test users

3. **Configure Synthetic Users for Testing**
   - Add test user IDs to PostHog: `test-user-001@morning-pod.com`, etc.
   - Tag synthetic users with `user_type: 'synthetic'` property
   - Set up monitoring alerts for synthetic user error rates
