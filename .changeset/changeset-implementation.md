feat: implement comprehensive changeset version management system

- Add @changesets/cli for semantic versioning and changelog generation
- Create Facebook-inspired canary deployment strategy using PostHog feature flags
- Implement synthetic user testing framework for safe canary rollouts
- Add comprehensive deployment strategy documentation
- Configure changeset scripts in package.json (changeset, version, publish, release)
- Update development workflows in .cursorrules and .claude-code-rules
- Document next steps for manual setup and automated implementation phases

This establishes enterprise-level version management and deployment confidence at zero infrastructure cost, using only free tiers (Vercel, PostHog, GitHub Actions).
