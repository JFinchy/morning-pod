## Current Task: Integration Testing

**Goal**: Full pipeline testing with API keys

### Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Configure OpenAI API Key** - Add to `.env.local` for testing
2. **Test Full Pipeline** - Run complete episode generation end-to-end
3. **Configure Vercel Blob** - Add storage token for audio files
4. **UI Integration** - Connect frontend to working generation API

## Development Context

### Available Infrastructure

- ✅ Database schema with episodes, sources, scraped_content tables
- ✅ tRPC API with routers for all entities
- ✅ Comprehensive UI component library with variants
- ✅ PostHog analytics and feature flags
- ✅ Working scraper system with database persistence
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:3000

### Environment Status

- **Dev server**: Running successfully with Turbopack
- **Database**: Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
- **Scrapers**: Tested and working with database persistence
- **Routes**: All pages accessible including `/scraping`

### Known Issues to Address

- Need to rebuild AI services (summarization + TTS)
- Missing generation API endpoint
- Need generation trigger in UI
- Audio storage integration needed

## Technical Strategy

### MVP Approach

- **Simple synchronous generation**: User clicks → scrape → summarize → TTS → done
- **No complex queue system**: Direct API call with loading states
- **Error handling**: Clear user feedback for any failures
- **Cost awareness**: Track OpenAI usage for both summarization and TTS

### File Creation Plan

```
src/lib/services/ai/
├── summarization.ts     # OpenAI GPT integration
├── tts.ts              # OpenAI TTS integration
└── types.ts            # Shared AI service types

src/app/api/episodes/
└── generate/
    └── route.ts        # Generation endpoint

src/components/features/
└── episode-generator.tsx  # Generation UI component
```

## Decision Context

### Why MVP-First Approach

- Validate the full pipeline end-to-end
- Get user feedback on generated content quality
- Understand cost implications before scaling
- Build confidence in AI service integrations

### Why OpenAI for Both Services

- Consistent API patterns and error handling
- Good quality for both summarization and TTS
- Simplified cost tracking and management
- Single vendor relationship for initial validation

## 🤔 Decision Points for User

1. **Which next phase interests you most?**

   - Advanced episode features (playlists, favorites, analytics)
   - Enhanced generation options (multiple AI providers, templates)
   - Production deployment (go live with current features)

2. **OpenAI Quota Resolution:**

   - Do you want to upgrade OpenAI billing to test full generation?
   - Or proceed with other development using existing episodes?

3. **Testing Priorities:**
   - Should we test episode playback with existing episodes first?
   - Or focus on building additional features?

**Recommendation**: Test episode playback functionality with any existing episodes in the database, then choose next development phase based on your priorities.
